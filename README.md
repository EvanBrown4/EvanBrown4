- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EvanBrown4
I am currently a junior at Rice University pursuing my Bachelors degree in computer science and statistics, with a minor in data science.
I am passionate about data science and working to create newer and better algorithms and strategies to solve modern day problems.

I have always been interested in data science and analytics, trying to find new ways to look at data and new ways to predict outcomes.
I aspire to learn more about data science and machine learning and develop groundbreaking tools.
